# FizzBuzz
My attempt at fizz-buzz test (http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest)

I tried to test-drive my solution, so I don't see this as perfect in terms of memory and-or performance - IF that is a concern.

As a basic solution, I'm happy to have multiple calls as long as I can test it.
Ideally, would've liked to add one more test to verify processAll - maybe assert the number of times 'fizz' and 'buzz' are printed...
